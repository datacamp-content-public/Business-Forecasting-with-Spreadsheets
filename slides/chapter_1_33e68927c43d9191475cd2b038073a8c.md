## Forecasting Sales: the plan

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4587b6f3fe"
```

`@part1`
We will be using Walmart Inc Sales data for the years 1994 â€“ 2018, a run of 25 years and in this demonstration we will


`@script`
- Review the data by inspection
- Create a linear regression equation
- Plot the data on a graph and review it
- Add a linear trendline to the graph
- Change the default Linear trendline
- Check the predictions

## Review the Data by Inspection

```yaml

`@script`
Here are the sales results in US$ for Walmart for the last 25 years. A table is an efficient way of storing data but it is difficult to assess trends from them.

## Create a Linear Regression Equation

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "99e1ac9b84"
```

`@part1`
A basic linear regression equation looks like this: Y = a + bX, where

- a = Intercept
- b = Slope
- X = The Year Number

## Create a Linear Regression Equation

`@script`
A linear regression equation comprises an intercept term and a slope term: in the equation Y = a + bX, a is the intercept and b the slope.
We can use the INTERCEPT function and the SLOPE function as two separate elements and combine them in two or three ways when we need to.
Here, the range B5:B30 contains the X Series data and the range C5:C30 contains the Y series 
We can also use the R Squared function, RSQ using the same X and Y data series to help us to assess the behaviour of the data and the model
Our Equation for Walmart is Y = 62,403.69 + 19,256.08X with R Squared = 0.9817

## Plot the Data on a Graph and Review it

`@script`
We have seen the data and we have created a regression equation for the data but the scattergraph shown here shows

- an increasing, upward, trend
- a trend that is **not entirely linear**
- A relatively steep trend that seems to have levelled off over the last five years

## Add a Linear Trendline with its Equation and R2

```yaml

`@script`
We add a Trendline to a scattergraph in google sheets in this way

- Year Numbers on the X axis and Sales data on the Y axis
- Double click on the data line to open the customise dialogue box and follow the guidance of the graphic on the right hand side of this slide 
The equation and R squared information are in the Legend

## Exponential, Logarithmic, Power and Polynomial Trendlines with R Squared

`@script`
The graph here contains the Power Series Trendline, equation and R Squared value. To change the equation from Linear to Power, just change the Type setting you saw on the previous slide from Linear to Power Series. Other Trendlines are
Exponential
Logarithmic
Polynomial

## Summary of the Equations

`@part2`
- Here we see all of the equations and R Squared values for this exercise. Since they are using different mathematical methods, the structure of the equations vary.
- The higher the R Squared value the better and the Polynomial Order 2 equations seems optimal


`@script`
Polynomial Order 2 seems optimal, on the other hand, the R Squared for the linear function is very high at 0.982. So, is it worth the extra effort of creating all of these regression equations?
In other words, we could stick with Y = a + bX and be reasonably happy!

## Line by Line Predictions/Forecasts

`@script`
Having created our linear equation by whatever method, we can then apply it to the data and see what its predictions are and the residuals or differences it throws up, line by line.
As a matter of interest, we could extend the Year Number column to 26, 27 ... 30 and fill down our equation to make forecasts for those years.
Repeat this exercise for the other Trendline Equation types.

## Examine the Residuals

`@script`
The Residuals column shows the differences between Actual Sales and Predicted sales: accountants call them variances.
There should be no pattern to the residuals on the Actual Sales v Residuals graph but in this case there is: this tells us that whilst our model looks good, there is a weakness to it.
The wavy line pattern in the residuals tells us that a non linear equation would probably work better or that another variable should be added to the model

## Conclusions

```yaml

center_content: false
```

`@part1`
This demonstration has illustrated how we can begin the process of forecasting data: Sales data in this case.


`@part2`
What we have done is to step through the basic process that leaves you with data, equations, graphs, tables, predictions and conclusions as to the best possible model
