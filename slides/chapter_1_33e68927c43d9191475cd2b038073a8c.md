## Forecasting Sales: the plan

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4587b6f3fe"
```

`@part1`
We will be using Walmart Inc Sales data for the years 1994 â€“ 2018, a run of 25 years and in this demonstration we will

- Review the data by inspection
- Create a linear regression equation
- Plot the data on a graph and review it
- Add a linear trendline to the graph
- Change the default Linear trendline to help us to find the best forecasting model
- Check the predictions

## Review the Data by Inspection

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "d8cc3f999a"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`

`@script`
Here are the sales results for Walmart for the last 25 years. The data are in US$ millions and it should be clear that whilst a table is an efficient way of storing data, it is difficult to assess trends past, present and future.

## Create a Linear Regression Equation

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "99e1ac9b84"
```

`@part1`
A basic linear regression equation looks like this: Y = a + bX, where

- a = Intercept
- b = Slope
- X = The Year Number

## Create a Linear Regression Equation

```yaml

center_content: true
```

`@script`
A linear regression equation comprises an intercept term and a slope term: in the equation Y = a + bX, a is the intercept and b the slope.
To create the function, we can use the INTERCEPT function and the SLOPE function as two separate elements and combine them in two or three ways when we need to.
In this example, Column B contains the X Series data, in the range B5:B30 and column C contains the Y series data in the range C5:C30 
We can also use the R Square function, RSQ using the same input X and Y data series that will help us to assess the behaviour of the data and the model
Our Equation for Walmart is Y = 62,403.69 + 19,256.08X with R Squared = 0.9817

## Plot the Data on a Graph and Review it

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"

`@script`
We have seen the data and we have created a regression equation for the data but we have yet to appreciate the nature and behaviour of the data. The scattergraph shown here shows

- an increasing, upward, trend
- a trend that is **not entirely linear**
- A relatively steep trend that seems to have levelled off over the last four or five years

## Add a Linear Trendline with its Equation and R2

```yaml

`@script`
We add a Trendline to a scattergraph in google sheets in this way

- Create your scattergraph: Year Numbers on the X axis and Sales date on the Y axis
- Double click on the data line to open the customize dialogue box and follow the guidance of the graphic on the right hand side of this slide 
The equation and R squared information are in the Legend area of the graph

## Exponential, Logarithmic, Power and Polynomial Trendlines with R Squared

```yaml

`@script`
The graph here contains the Power regression Trendline, equation and R Squared value. To change the equation from Linear to Power, just change the Type setting you saw on the previous slide from Linear to Power Series. Other Trendlines that you should also explore are
Exponential
Logarithmic
Polynomial

## Summary of the Equations

`@part2`
- Here we see all of the equations and R Squared values for this exercise. Since they are using different mathematical methods, the structure of the equations vary.
- The higher the R Squared value the better and to that end, the Polynomial Order 2 equations seems optimal


`@script`
On the other hand, the value of R Squared for the linear function is very high at 0.982 where the maximum value is 1.000. We must ask the question now, is it worth all of the extra effort by creating all of the regression equations and choosing, in this case, possibly the most complex formula to work with.
In other words, we could stick with Y = a + bX and be happy!

## Line by Line Predictions/Forecasts

```yaml

`@script`
Having created our linear equation by whatever method, we can then apply it to the data and see what its predictions are and the residuals or differences it throws up on a line by line basis.
As a matter of interest, we could extend the Year Number column to 26, 27 ... 30 and fill down our equation to make forecasts for those years.
Repeat this exercise for all of the other Equation types

## Examine the Residuals

```yaml

`@script`
The residuals column simply shows he differences between Actual Sales and Predicted sales: accountants call them variances.
There should be no pattern to the residuals on the Actual sales v Residuals graph but in this case there is: this tells us that whilst our model looks god, there is a flaw in it.
The wavy line pattern in the residuals tells us that a on linear equation would probably work better or that another variable should be added to the model

## Conclusions

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "2ff1801ed3"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
This demonstration has illustrated how we can begin the process of forecasting data: Sales data in this case.


`@part2`
What we have done is to step through the basic process that leaves you with data, equations, graphs, tables, predictions and conclusions as to the best possible model
